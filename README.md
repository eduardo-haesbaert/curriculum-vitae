# Curriculum Vitae â€“ HTML Project

This project is a **single-page Curriculum Vitae (CV)** built entirely with **semantic HTML**. It was created as part of an educational assignment focused on learning how to structure a professional webpage using only HTML and CSS.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

The main goal of this assignment is to:
- Develop a clean, well-structured, and semantic HTML page that represents a personal CV.
- Learn how to properly organize sections such as education, work experience, skills, and contact information using HTML5 best practices.
- Prepare the structure of the CV for future styling using CSS.

## âœ… Key Features

### âœ… Semantic HTML
The CV uses appropriate semantic tags such as:
- `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`  
- `<h1>` to `<h3>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<p>`, `<address>`, and others  
This helps with accessibility and prepares the document for SEO and styling.

### âœ… SEO Meta Tags
Essential meta tags are included in the `<head>` section to help search engines understand the content:
```html
<meta name="description" content="Curriculum Vitae of [Your Name]">
<meta name="keywords" content="CV, Curriculum Vitae, HTML, Web Development, [Your Name]">
<meta name="author" content="[Your Name]">

```
